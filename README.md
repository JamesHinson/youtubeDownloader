### A simple python script to download YouTube videos


Given a link to a video or playlist, this program will download the video(s) from YouTube to a folder titled 'videos' or 'playlists' depending on what is entered.

This script imports the module 'pytube' for downloading videos and managing the connection to YouTube, and also uses the 're' module for regex matching and filtering.

*As always, this script is work-in-progress and is being updated with new features as they come.*
